# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization
This project analyzes the COVID-19 data of various countries around the world using Pandas, Numpy ,Matplotlib, Seaborn ,sklearn ,geopandas.

Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib: Plotting graphs and charts

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization

GeoPandas: Handling and visualizing geographic data

NumPy: Numerical operations

Scikit-Learn: Clustering and scaling (K-Means, StandardScaler)

Installation
To install the required libraries, you can use the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas numpy scikit-learn
Data Source
The data used in this analysis was obtained from a CSV file containing country-level COVID-19 statistics such as:

Confirmed cases

Deaths

Incident rate

Mortality rate

Cases and deaths in the last 28 days

The dataset can be loaded and processed using Pandas.

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
The data is loaded using Pandas, and missing values are handled where necessary. Features such as Incident Rate and Mortality Rate are selected for further analysis.

2. Clustering Countries Using K-Means
We apply the K-Means algorithm from Scikit-learn to cluster countries based on Incident Rate and Mortality Rate. The countries are divided into groups that highlight distinct patterns in these rates.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Clustering countries based on Incident Rate and Mortality Rate

# Apply KMeans clustering
Bubble chart: A plot of Confirmed cases vs Deaths, with bubble sizes representing the Incident Rate.

K-Means Clustering: A scatterplot showing the clustering of countries based on Incident Rate and Mortality Rate.

Countries with Low Confirmed and High Mortality: Identification of countries that might be underreporting cases.

Countries with Rapidly Declining Cases: Highlighting countries where COVID-19 cases are decreasing significantly.

# Bubble chart: Confirmed vs Deaths
:

Underreporting: Countries with low confirmed cases but high mortality may indicate underreporting.

Healthcare Efficiency: Countries with many recent cases but zero recent deaths may have better healthcare systems.

Rapid Case Decline: Identifying countries with declining COVID-19 cases.

How to Run the Code
Clone this repository or download the code files.

Install the required libraries using the pip command.

Make sure the COVID-19 dataset (CSV file) is available in your directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook (Analysis.ipynb) or Python script (analysis.py) to execute the analysis and see the results.
